# Quick Deployment Guide - FIXED DEPENDENCIES

## 🚀 Deploy to Render (Recommended)

**Dependencies have been fixed!** The version conflicts are resolved.

### Steps:

1. **Push to GitHub** (already done ✅)

2. **Go to Render.com**
   - Sign up with GitHub
   - Click "New +" → "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repo: `DTE-Circulars-Scraper`

3. **Use these exact settings:**
   ```
   Name: dte-circulars-scraper
   Environment: Node
   Build Command: npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build
   Start Command: npm start
   ```

4. **Environment Variables** (Add these):
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true
   PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable
   ```

5. **Deploy!** 🎉
   - Should take ~4-5 minutes
   - Your app will be live at: `https://dte-circulars-scraper.onrender.com`

## ✅ What Was Fixed:
- ❌ Removed conflicting `chrome-aws-lambda` dependency
- ❌ Removed `puppeteer-core` dependency conflict  
- ✅ Clean `puppeteer@21.11.0` only
- ✅ Added `--legacy-peer-deps` flag for build
- ✅ Regenerated clean package-lock.json

---

## 🔧 Why Other Platforms Have Issues:

### **Netlify:**
- ❌ Free tier: 10-second function timeout
- ❌ Complex Puppeteer setup required
- ❌ Additional dependencies needed

### **Heroku:**
- ⚠️ Requires special buildpacks
- ⚠️ More complex configuration
- ⚠️ Slower cold starts

### **Railway:**
- ✅ Works well (alternative to Render)
- ⚠️ Slightly more expensive

---

## 🎯 Recommendation: Use Render

**Your app is now optimized for Render deployment. Just follow the steps above and it should work perfectly!**

The build timeout issues are fixed with:
- `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true`
- System Chrome usage
- Optimized dependencies
